## � Background: Understanding the Starter Code

The starter code simulates a CPU scheduling system where multiple processes compete for CPU time. Each process is represented by a `Process` class, and the `SchedulerSimulation` class manages their execution using a Round-Robin algorithm. Understanding these classes will help you complete the assignment.

### `Process` Class:
The `Process` class represents an individual process in the CPU scheduling simulation. Each process has **attributes** like a *name*, *burst time*, *remaining time*, and *time quantum*. **The process will either run for a specified time quantum or, if it is the last remaining process in the system, it will run until completion without [yielding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yield_(multithreading)) the CPU.**

#### Attributes:
- `String name`: The name of the process (e.g., "P1", "P2"). Used for identification in output messages.
- `int burstTime`: The total amount of time (in milliseconds) that the process requires to complete its execution. This is randomly assigned when the process is created.
- `int timeQuantum`: The time slice (in milliseconds) for which a process is allowed to run in each round-robin cycle. This value is fixed for all processes.
- `int remainingTime`: The remaining time (in milliseconds) for the process to complete. Initially, this is equal to the burstTime and decreases as the process runs.

#### Methods:
- `Process(String name, int burstTime, int timeQuantum)`: Constructor that initializes the `Process` object with a given `name`, `burstTime`, and `timeQuantum`. The `remainingTime` is initially set to be the same as the `burstTime`.
- `void run()`: 
  - Implements the `Runnable` interface's `run()` method. This method simulates the execution of the process for one time quantum or the remaining time, whichever is smaller.
  - After running for the allowed time, the remaining time is updated.
  - If the process still has time left to execute, it yields the CPU and is re-enqueued; otherwise, it completes its execution.
  - This method is always called when a `Thread` is started for the process.
- `void runToCompletion()`: 
  - This method is called when the process is the last one in the queue. Instead of running for a time quantum, the process runs until its remaining time reaches zero, meaning the process completes in a single run without being interrupted.
  - This method ensures that the last process does not get re-enqueued but instead finishes execution in one go.
- `String getName()`: A simple getter method to retrieve the name of the process.
- `int getBurstTime()`: A getter method to retrieve the total burst time (i.e., the full time the process needs for completion).
- `int getRemainingTime()`: A getter method to retrieve the remaining time that the process needs to complete its execution.
- `boolean isFinished()`: This method checks whether the process has completed its execution. It returns true if the remainingTime is less than or equal to zero, meaning no time is left for the process to run.

**Note:** The complete `Process` class implementation is available in the starter repository you will fork from GitHub.

### `SchedulerSimulation` Class:
The `SchedulerSimulation` class is responsible for managing the lifecycle and scheduling of processes. **It handles the creation of processes, placing them in a queue, and running them using a Round-Robin scheduling algorithm**. **When only one process remains, it runs to completion without respect to the time quantum**.

#### Attributes:
No instance variables in the class, but several data structures and constants are used within the methods.

#### Methods:
1. `public static void main(String[] args)`: This is the entry point of the program. It simulates the scheduling of processes based on a Round-Robin algorithm with a fixed time quantum.

   **Key Tasks in main:**
   - **Time Quantum:** Defines the time quantum for scheduling, which is a random value between 2000 and 5000 milliseconds with a step of 1000 milliseconds. **The random seed is based on the student ID, so you are required to replace the seed with your student ID.**
   - **Process Creation:** Creates a specified number of processes (numProcesses). This number is randomly chosen between 10 and 20 according to the provided seed.
   - **Process Queueing:** Processes are added to a FIFO queue (`processQueue`), and each process is associated with its corresponding thread using a `Map<Thread, Process> (processMap)`. Each process has a unique name and burst time (randomly assigned between `timeQuantum/2` and `3×timeQuantum`).
   - **Scheduler Loop:** The scheduler retrieves each process from the queue and executes it using a thread. It checks whether a process is finished after its time quantum:
     - *If the process is not finished and there are other processes in the queue, it is re-enqueued.*
     - *If the process is the last one remaining, it is allowed to run until completion without being interrupted.*
   - **Completion:** The simulation ends when all processes have finished execution.

2. `public static void addProcessToQueue(Process process, Queue<Thread> processQueue, Map<Thread, Process> processMap)`: 
   - This helper method is responsible for adding a `Process` to the `processQueue` and associating it with a new `Thread` in the `processMap`. It also prints a message indicating that the process has entered the ready queue.
   
   **Parameters:**
   - `Process process`: The process to be added to the queue.
   - `Queue<Thread> processQueue`: The queue that manages threads in a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) order.
   - `Map<Thread, Process> processMap`: A mapping of threads to processes, so the scheduler can easily retrieve the process associated with each thread.
   
   - **Message:** Prints details about the process, including its burst time and remaining time, when it enters the ready queue.

**Note:** The complete `SchedulerSimulation` class implementation is available in the starter repository you will fork from GitHub. You will modify this file to add your student ID and implement the required features.

**Commit Examples:**
- ✅ `"Feature 1: Added priority field to Process class"`
- ✅ `"Feature 2: Implemented context switch counter"`
- ✅ `"Feature 3: Added waiting time tracking and summary"`
- ❌ `"done"` or `"update"` or `"final version"` (too vague!)

#### 2.1: Feature 1 - Add Process Priority (1 mark)
- Add a `priority` field to the Process class (integer 1-5, where 5 is highest)
- Generate random priorities when creating processes
- Display priority when a process enters the ready queue
- Example output: `"P1 (Priority: 4) enters the ready queue..."`
- Add clear comments explaining your additions

#### 2.2: Feature 2 - Count Context Switches (1 mark)
- Add a static counter variable for context switches
- Increment the counter each time a new process starts running
- Display total context switches at the end of simulation
- Example: `"Total context switches: 47"`
- A context switch occurs every time the CPU switches to a different process

#### 2.3: Feature 3 - Track Waiting Time (1 mark)
- Add fields to track when each process was created and total time spent waiting
- Calculate waiting time for each process
- Use `System.currentTimeMillis()` to track time
- Display a summary table at the end showing:
  - Process Name
  - Burst Time
  - Waiting Time
- Format the output in a clear, readable table
